# Franglais

## Background

Use [Franglais](https://unrivaled-panda-92bf9a.netlify.app/start-language-learning "Franglais") to build your own French dictionary. 

You can:

* record words and phrases
* refer back to them
* revise them
* see how many you've learnt

When I was studying French at university, I often came across words and phrases while I was out and wanted somewhere to record them. For example, I would see some unfamiliar vocab in a French book while I was travelling, and wanted to remember it.

I found the notes app on my phone didn't inspire me to refer back to my notes. There weren't many options for organising my language notes. 

There are lots of opportunities to expand on this MVP. I conceived this as an app for any language, but given the short timeframe to build the project I have focussed on just one language.

To expand this, I'd like give the option to select multiple languages, so that you can have multiple dictionaries accessible from a landing page.

* bcrypt
* node.js



## Future enhancements

1. Create a revision view so that you can see words and phrases on revision cards on a carousel:

2. Cater for multiple languages:

3. Do more with data and inputs, for example:

* allow you to link associated words and phrases
* allow you to specify the type of entry e.g. noun, verb
* create a field for adding prepositions e.g. 'le' or 'la'

4. Improve the design, for example:

* catering for different screen sizes such as mobile - this app is conceived to be used on the go
* improve or completely change the branding depending on the scope of the design

I also need to tidy up the code, for example:

* refactoring it to include controllers to break up the server.js file 
* being smarter with css rules
