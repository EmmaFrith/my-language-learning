# Franglais

## Background

Use [Franglais]() to build your own French dictionary. 

You can:

* record words and phrases
* refer back to them
* revise them
* see how many you've learnt

When I was studying French at university, I often came across words and phrases while I was out and wanted somewhere to record them. For example, I would see some unfamiliar vocab in a French book while I was travelling, and wanted to remember it.

I found the notes app on my phone didn't inspire me to refer back to my notes. There weren't many options for organising my language notes. 

There are lots of opportunities to expand on this MVP. I orginally conceieved this as an app for any language, but given the short timeframe to build the project I have focussed on just one language.

To expand this, I'd like give the option to select mutiple languages, so that you can have multiple dictionaries accessible from a landing page.
